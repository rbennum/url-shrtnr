# Tech Specification Document

## 1. Title and Overview

Title: Clear, descriptive title of the document.

Overview: A brief summary of what the document will cover, including the problem being solved, high-level objectives, and key deliverables.

## 2. Scope

In-Scope: Define what the document will cover (specific features, APIs, services).

Out-of-Scope: Clearly state what is not covered, helping to avoid scope creep.

## 3. Architecture Overview

System Architecture Diagram: A high-level diagram (like a flowchart or UML) showing the components, services, and how they interact.

Technology Stack: List the technologies, languages, frameworks, and databases that will be used.

## 4. Detailed Design

Components: Break down each system component (e.g., microservices, modules) and explain their purpose.

APIs/Endpoints: Detail the API specifications, including: Endpoint URLs, Request/Response formats (e.g., JSON), HTTP Methods (GET, POST, etc.), Authentication/Authorization Requirements

Data Models: Define the data models (with schemas) that will be used for databases, including field types, relationships, and validation rules.

## 5. Use Cases/Requirements

Use Case Scenarios: Describe common scenarios and how the system handles them.

Functional Requirements: List the specific behaviors or outputs expected from the system.

Non-Functional Requirements: Detail performance metrics, scalability expectations, security needs, and any legal/regulatory requirements.

## 6. Workflow and Process Flow

Workflow Diagrams: Visualize the flow of data and actions through the system (e.g., user authentication process, data retrieval).

Sequence Diagrams: Explain interactions between services in detail, outlining the order of operations.

## 7. Error Handling

Error Codes and Messages: Define how errors will be handled and the standard responses (e.g., HTTP error codes).

Fallback Strategies: Explain what happens if something goes wrong and how the system recovers.

## 8. Database Design

ER Diagrams: Diagram of the database tables and their relationships.

Indexes and Optimization: Describe any indexing, caching, or performance optimization techniques.

## 9. Security Considerations

Authentication/Authorization: How user identities are verified and permissions managed.

Data Encryption: How sensitive data will be encrypted both at rest and in transit.

Vulnerabilities: Outline potential security risks and mitigation strategies.

## 10. Testing Strategy

Unit Tests: Describe what should be covered by unit tests and how they will be written.

Integration Tests: Plan for testing how different modules and services interact.

Load/Performance Testing: Metrics and plans for performance testing (e.g., maximum supported users, response times).

## 11. Deployment Strategy

CI/CD Pipeline: Detail the continuous integration/continuous deployment workflow and tools.

Environments: Define development, testing, staging, and production environments.

Rollback Plan: Describe the rollback strategy in case of deployment failure.

## 12. Monitoring and Logging

Monitoring Tools: Specify which tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) will be used to monitor system performance and health.

Logging: Define logging levels (error, info, debug) and where logs will be stored and reviewed.

## 13. Dependencies

External Dependencies: List external systems, services, or APIs the project depends on.

Library Dependencies: Detail the libraries and packages used and their versions.

## 14. Conclusion

Summary: Recap the overall plan and its importance.

Next Steps: Define the immediate next steps in the implementation process (e.g., code development, testing, etc.).

## 15. Appendices

Glossary: Define any technical terms or acronyms.

References: Include links to any external resources, libraries, or documents.
