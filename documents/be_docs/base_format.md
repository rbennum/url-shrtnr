APIs/Endpoints: Detail the API specifications, including: Endpoint URLs, Request/Response formats (e.g., JSON), HTTP Methods (GET, POST, etc.), Authentication/Authorization Requirements

Data Models: Define the data models (with schemas) that will be used for databases, including field types, relationships, and validation rules.

Example:

    Components:
        1. Authentication Controller:
            - Handles user registration, login, and token generation.
        2. OAuth Handler:
            - Manages OAuth integration, fetching user data from third-party providers.
        3. Session Manager:
            - Stores and manages user sessions using Redis.

    APIs/Endpoints:
        - POST /api/v1/register
            - Request
                {
                    "email": "user@example.com",
                    "password": "strongpassword"
                }
            - Response
                {
                    "message": "User registered successfully"
                }

        - POST /api/v1/login
            - Request
                {
                    "email": "user@example.com",
                    "password": "strongpassword"
                }
            - Response
                {
                    "token": "jwt-token-here"
                }
        - GET /api/v1/oauth/google
            - Handles Google OAuth login, redirects to /api/v1/oauth/callback.

    Data Models:
        User Table Schema:
            |Column|Type|Description|
            |id|UUID|Primary key|
            |email|String|User's email|
            |password_hash|String|Encrypted password|
            |created_at|DateTime|Account creation date|
            |updated_at|DateTime|Last update timestamp|

## 5. Use Cases/Requirements

Use Case Scenarios: Describe common scenarios and how the system handles them.

Functional Requirements: List the specific behaviors or outputs expected from the system.

Non-Functional Requirements: Detail performance metrics, scalability expectations, security needs, and any legal/regulatory requirements.

Example:

    Use Case Scenarios:

    Scenario 1: User Registration
        - The user enters their email and password. The system hashes the password, saves it in the database, and sends a confirmation email.

    Scenario 2: User Login
        - The user provides their credentials. If valid, the system generates a JWT and returns it to the user for subsequent API requests.

    Functional Requirements:
        - Secure password hashing using bcrypt.
        - JWT-based stateless authentication.

    Non-Functional Requirements:
        - The authentication service should be able to handle 500 requests per second.
        - JWT tokens should expire after 24 hours.

## 6. Workflow and Process Flow

Workflow Diagrams: Visualize the flow of data and actions through the system (e.g., user authentication process, data retrieval).

Sequence Diagrams: Explain interactions between services in detail, outlining the order of operations.

Example:

    Workflow Diagrams:
        User Login Workflow:
            - User sends login credentials.
            - System verifies credentials.
            - On success, generates JWT token.
            - User stores JWT for future API calls.

    Sequence Diagrams:
        User Registration Flow:
            - User submits registration form.
            - Backend hashes password and saves user data in PostgreSQL.
            - System sends confirmation email.
            - User confirms, and account becomes active.

## 7. Error Handling

Error Codes and Messages: Define how errors will be handled and the standard responses (e.g., HTTP error codes).

Fallback Strategies: Explain what happens if something goes wrong and how the system recovers.

Example:

    Error Codes and Messages:
        - 400 Bad Request: Invalid input data (e.g., missing email or password).
        - 401 Unauthorized: Incorrect credentials or token expired.
        - 500 Internal Server Error: Generic server error (e.g., database failure).

    Fallback Strategies:
        - On database failure, retry mechanism will be implemented with a maximum of 3 retries before returning a failure response.

## 8. Database Design

ER Diagrams: Diagram of the database tables and their relationships.

Indexes and Optimization: Describe any indexing, caching, or performance optimization techniques.

Example:

    ER Diagram:
        - User â†’ Session (1 to many relationship)

    Indexes and Optimization:
        - Index on email column in the User table for fast lookup during login.
        - Use pgcrypto extension for UUID generation in PostgreSQL.

## 9. Security Considerations

Authentication/Authorization: How user identities are verified and permissions managed.

Vulnerabilities: Outline potential security risks and mitigation strategies.

Example:

    Authentication/Authorization:
        - Passwords will be hashed using bcrypt with a salt.
        - All tokens will be signed using the HS256 algorithm for JWT.

    Data Encryption:
        - All sensitive data will be encrypted in transit using TLS/SSL.
        - Passwords will never be stored in plaintext.

    Vulnerabilities:
        - CSRF protection using token-based validation.
        - Rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.

## 10. Testing Strategy

Unit Tests: Describe what should be covered by unit tests and how they will be written.

Integration Tests: Plan for testing how different modules and services interact.

Example:

    Unit Tests:
        - Test all controllers for valid input/output, including edge cases (e.g., invalid email format).

    Integration Tests:
        - Test interactions between the authentication service and the Redis session store.
        - Mock OAuth provider responses and test OAuth flow.

    Load/Performance Testing:
        - Target performance: handle 500 concurrent login requests with a response time of less than 200ms.

## 11. Deployment Strategy

CI/CD Pipeline: Detail the continuous integration/continuous deployment workflow and tools.

Environments: Define development, testing, staging, and production environments.

        - Staging: Pre-production environment with testing data.
        - Production: Live environment with real user data.
    
    Rollback Plan:
        - A blue-green deployment strategy will be employed to ensure safe rollbacks in case of production failures.

## 12. Monitoring and Logging

Monitoring Tools: Specify which tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) will be used to monitor system performance and health.

Logging: Define logging levels (error, info, debug) and where logs will be stored and reviewed.

Example:

    Monitoring Tools:
        - Prometheus: Track system metrics such as response times, CPU usage, and memory consumption.

    Logging:
        - ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized logging.
