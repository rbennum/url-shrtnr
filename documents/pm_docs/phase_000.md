# Phase 0 – Project Motivation

## Feature Overview

Feature name: **url-shrtnr**.

Purpose: the world has over a million URL shortener to offer, and it's still lacking. As the citizen of the world, it is my job to balance it all out.

## Problem Statement

Users want 'em short.

## Goals and Objectives

This project shall gives users what they need—a shorter URL.

## Stakeholders

No idea. I heard they were a cutie though.

## Feature Scope

- A main site to handle the creation part of the URL shortener (localhost:8080).
- A preview site to redirect users to the real sites (localhost:5000).
- A URL to short will be stored inside a database.
- After shortening process is done, users will be given a shortened URL with this format (localhost:5000/random-5-chars). The random string serves as the base paired with the real URL.
- If the string doesn't exist, then a 404 page will be shown.

## Assumptions and Constraints

For initials, there will be no Docker involved. We're doing it the old way.

## High-Level Timeline

No milestone needed for this initial project. It will take a day to implement all these, give or take.
